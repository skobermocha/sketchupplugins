### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
	download repository file
	locate the folder from the download
		DT-Tools
			Should contain 2 folders
			Materials
			Plugins
	navitage local folder directory to the Sketchup Install Path
		On a Windows machine it looks like this
		C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2017\SketchUp
			you should find a folder named "Materials" and "Plugins" here as well.
			the idea is to copy the downloaded files INTO the correct folder.
			Inside the downloaded folder for "Materials" you will find a folder for "DT-RNC"
				this whole folder needs to be copied INTO the local folder;
				C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2017\SketchUp\Materials
			Inside the download folder for "Plugins" you will find a file and folder.
				Both of these needs to be copied INTO the local folder
				C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2017\SketchUp\Plugins
				
* Dependencies
	Sketchup 2016 or newer
